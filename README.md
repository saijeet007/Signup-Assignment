# SignUp WebAPP
 
Created a web application that allows users to sign up by filling out a form with fields like 
name, number, date of birth (DOB), email, and password. Implemented validation for each 
field, and enabled the submit button only when all fields have valid data.

Also added optional Features as well
1. Implemented a feature to edit or delete user profiles. 
2. Added additional fields to the user profile, such as a profile picture upload. 
3. Used a frontend library ReactJs for building the application.
